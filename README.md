# DanteMode
(In private development for ~6 months) Dante, my discord bot. Open source project in development and not optimized for other filesystems, install and setup script in development

Use with your own caution, a lot of development needs to be done and this is not plug and play at the moment.

What I need to do:
- substitute my file directories for an enviroment variable (directory setup is run in?)
- create a setup script
- add a requirements.txt
- basic instructions on how to manually set up
- fix long mode

Whats been done:
- Source code made for my file system
- Actual bot release
- Optimized ML for speed and realism (on gtx 1060 6 gb with cuda, 10 min for decent image)

What you need to run it:
- decent cpu
- gtx 1060, nvidia equivelant or better
- cuda support
- python
- a will to untangle this mess
