# DanteMode
(In private development for ~6 months) Dante, my discord bot. Open source project in development and not optimized for other filesystems, install and setup script in development

Use with your own caution, a lot of development needs to be done and this is not plug and play at the moment.

- basic instructions on how to manually set up
- fix long mode

Whats been done:
- Make a setup script
- Untested universal install
- Source code

What you need to run it:
- decent cpu
- gtx 1060, nvidia equivelant or better

3. When setup has finished, run start.sh
